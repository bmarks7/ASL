I was the project manager for a team of 4 students during the summer of 2020 with a club at my university called Western AI.

Using TensorFlow and Numpy, we created a cat/dog image classification machine learning model with a convolutional neural network and achieved an accuracy of 98.5%.

We experimented with computer vision through this project.

To enable easier use of this model, we created a web application using Flask, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript and implemented the model into this web application, so users can upload an image of a cat or a dog and our application would predict which of the 2 animals it is.
